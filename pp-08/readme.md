# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: I think of how rugged it looks, how it seems to have gone through various owners that gave it hell and yet it still works. It also has a quaint look to it specially when comparing the T420 to the T60 it seems that IBM/Lenovo only changed the internal components of the laptop.

* Behavioral: It is a platform for me to do all different kinds of tasks such as; write papers; build websites; communicate with my peers through social media or IM; flash different firmware on my cellphone; play media and videogames; it's a bigger screen for pr0n mode :D

* Reflective: The T420 definitely goes more for function than it does with fashion. While it might not be the most aesthetic laptop it will pretty much handle any task you throw at it.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Quaint but usable
2. Focus on one thing and do it well.
3. Function first, fashion second
